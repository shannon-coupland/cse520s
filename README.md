# PDASC (Person-Detecting Affordable Security Camera)
*Team Members: Tommy Keating, Abby Magee, Shannon Coupland*

<p>This project was created for Washington University in St. Louis's CSE520S Real-Time Systems course. It features a Motion-powered motion detection security camera that sends images up to AWS Rekognition for person detection and facial recognition, which alerts the security camera owner when an unrecognized person is detected. A React app hosted on AWS EC2 shows a livestream from the camera, as well as a collection of past snapshots with unrecognized people.</p>
